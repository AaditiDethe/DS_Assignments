# Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Classification Projects
This repository contains assignments and mini-projects that apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for solving real-world classification problems. SVM is a powerful supervised learning technique used for both linear and non-linear classification tasks.

🔥 Assignment 1: Forest Fire Prediction
📌 Problem Statement:
Predict the category of burnt area in California forests using SVM, to assist officials in fire preparedness and resource planning.

🎯 Objective:
Enable long-term planning by classifying potential burn areas.

🔒 Constraints:

Seasonal & climatic variability

No real-time urgency

Must be cost-effective for public use

🧪 Techniques Used:

SVM (Linear & Polynomial kernels)

Data Encoding & Normalization

Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

✅ Conclusion:
SVM with a linear kernel achieved ~90% accuracy and is suitable for forest fire planning applications.

🏗️ Assignment 2: Construction Firm Investment Analysis
📌 Problem Statement:
Help a construction firm decide whether to invest in a suburban area based on population density and income levels using SVM classification.

🎯 Objective:
Support data-driven investment decisions to minimize risks.

🔒 Constraints:

Limited demographic data availability

Model should be simple & explainable

Fast turnaround for deployment

🧪 Techniques Used:

SVM (Linear & Polynomial kernels)

Data Preprocessing & Label Encoding

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

✅ Conclusion:
The model showed good accuracy and is effective as a decision-support tool for real estate investments.
